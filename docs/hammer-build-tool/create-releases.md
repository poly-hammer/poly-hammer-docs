# Creating Your Own Releases

As mentioned in the setup, we are not allowed to re-distribute the compiled dependencies needed for our tools. However, you can compile them and create new releases yourself with a simple GitHub workflow. Lets go through an example!

## Obtain a Product ID
After completing your [purchase](https://www.polyhammer.com/metahuman-addon), you'll recieve an email like the one below.  Take note of your `Product ID` as you will need this in the next step.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/hammer-build-tool/create-releases/1.png" alt="Test email" width="300" />
</div>

## Run the Build Tool
Now navigate to your repo that you made in the [setup](./setup.md). Go to the `Actions` tab and select the `Build` workflow and Click on the `Run workflow` dropdown.  Enter in your `Product ID`.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/hammer-build-tool/create-releases/2.png" alt="Run workflow"/>
</div>

!!!Note
    There are 4 inputs to the build tool workflow:

    a. **Workflow (Product ID)**: This must match the one in your confirmation email.

    b. **Version tag**: Using latest is typically fine, however you can specify a specific release tag if needed.

    c. **Python Version**: This version of python must be compatible with your version of Blender.

    d. **Blender Version**: The version of Blender you intend to use the addon in.

## Wait for the Build to Complete
After starting the workflow, you will need to wait for the build to complete. This can take some time (~15min or more). Once it finishes running, you will see a release on your repository's page.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/hammer-build-tool/create-releases/3.png" alt="Select addon release"/>
</div>

## Download the Release
Click on this release and download the release attachments. In this example, we can download the addon `meta_human_dna.zip` file here.
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/hammer-build-tool/create-releases/4.png" alt="Download Meta-Human addon"/>
</div>

## Success! ðŸŽ‰
Good work! You have now successfully built and downloaded the release for your product using the [Hammer Build Tool](setup.md)!
